## 📖 About the Project
**Planet Edu Cikgu Pizza** is a comprehensive education platform designed to move away from static learning materials. Built on a scalable **Laravel** architecture, this system transforms traditional teaching methods into an interactive digital experience.

The platform was developed to solve a key challenge: keeping students engaged with complex subjects. By integrating generative AI video and interactive reading tools, we've created a learning environment that is both fun and educational.

## ✨ Key Innovation: Google VEO 3 Integration
*(Implemented June 2025)*
To bridge the gap in understanding difficult concepts, I integrated **Google VEO 3** (Generative Video AI) directly into lesson pages. 
* **AI-Animated Explanations:** Automatically generates high-quality video summaries for complex topics.
* **Visual Learning:** Helps students visualize abstract concepts that are hard to explain with text alone.

## 📚 Core Features
* **Interactive Flipbook Library:** A custom-built engine that automatically converts standard PDF documents into paginated, interactive e-books with page-flipping effects.
* **Scalable Architecture:** Developed using **Laravel** to handle growing student databases and content repositories without performance loss.
* **Student Dashboard:** A personalized space for students to access video lessons, flipbooks, and track their progress.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Framework:** Laravel (PHP)
* **AI Model:** Google VEO 3 (Video Generation AI)
* **Frontend:** Interactive Flipbook.js implementation, Responsive Design
* **Database:** MySQL
